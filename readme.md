# Stampy

This repository hosts the source code for Stampy, a simple unix timestamp to readable date converter extension for Google Chrome.

## Installation

TBD

## Usage

Once you have installed the extension open up any web page and click the stampy icon. Any timestamps will be converted into readable dates for you. For instance the text `1574266854` will become `11/20/2019 @ 4:20:54 PM (UTC)` or similar, depending on your browser's locale settings. To clear any modifications this extension makes just reload the page.
