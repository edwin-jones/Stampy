# Stampy

This repository hosts the source code for Stampy, a simple unix timestamp to readable date converter extension for Chrome and Firefox.

## Installation

You can install stampy via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stampy/ccicllkpedpkilncdaololajfojgaodg) or [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/stampy/) page. Alternatively you can download the latest release from the releases page and install it manually.

## Usage

Once you have installed the extension open up any web page and click the stampy icon. Any timestamps will be converted into readable dates for you. For instance the text `1574266854` will become `20/11/2019 @ 4:20:54 PM (UTC)` or similar, depending on your browser's locale settings. To clear any modifications this extension makes just reload the page.
